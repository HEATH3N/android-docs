<!--### Permissions
Starting in 5.0, we are making use of the Manifest merge feature to reduce the need to include any Maps SDK required things inside of your application's manifest file. You'll need to include _either_ the Fine **or** Coarse location permission, if you plan to display a user's location on the map or get the user's location information. The user location permission should also be checked during runtime using the PermissionManager.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
```
